Switching Performance Code

This Python script processes and analyzes performance testing data from a CSV file. It performs various calculations and generates plots to visualize switching performance. The script uses external helper functions and Steady_state module for additional processing.

Usage:

Ensure required libraries are installed (psychrolib, pandas, numpy, matplotlib).
Set the path to your CSV file in the pd.read_csv line.
Run the script.
Output:

output_file.xlsx: Excel file containing processed data.
steady_state_processed_data.xlsx: Excel file with steady-state processed data.
switching_performance_plot.png: Plot visualizing switching performance.
Note: The script assumes the existence of external modules (helper_functions.py and Steady_state.py). Make sure they are available in the same directory.
